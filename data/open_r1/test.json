This shows that although the problem seems simple, a slight oversight can lead to errors in solving it.\n\nThis article introduces an effective method for solving such counting problems—the labeling method. It can effectively avoid the aforementioned mistakes.\n\nThe basic approach is to label each grid point with a number, and the number labeled at grid point $A$ represents the number of counting objects (such as isosceles right triangles) with $A$ as the special element.\n\nFor Example 1, since each isosceles right triangle has a unique right-angle vertex, we can consider the number of isosceles right triangles with each grid point as the right-angle vertex.\n\nOf course, once the right-angle vertex is determined, the isosceles right triangles can be divided into two major categories:\n(1) The legs are parallel to the grid lines (called upright);\n(2) The legs are not parallel to the grid lines (called slanted).\nFor each major category, they can be further classified by different directions.
